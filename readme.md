# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project


# **Retinal survival assay in** *Platynereis dumerilii*

## Introduction and Goals

The annelida phylum contains a great amount of variability in body plans. Many times, adaptation to novel environments resulted in a changes in body plan. This recurrent episodes of body plan evolution make them a good model for also understanding the evolution of Bilateria.
The marine annelid *Platynereis dumerilli* 

*The goal of my project is to answer the question, What is...?*
What is the best concentration of retinal to use taking into account survival time and imaging efficiency.

*The methods I will use to do this are...*

Python followed by R plotting.

*The data I will use are* 
Simulations or other publications' data.

## **Methods**

*The tools I used were... See analysis files at (links to analysis files).*

I installed SimPy
