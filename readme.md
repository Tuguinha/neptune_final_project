# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project


# **Retinal survival assay in** *Platynereis dumerilii*

## Introduction and Goals

The annelida phylum contains a great amount of variability in body plans. Many times, adaptation to novel environments resulted in a changes in body plan. This recurrent episodes of body plan evolution make them a good model for also understanding the evolution of Bilateria.

The goal of my project is to answer the question: What is the most suitable concentration of retinal for maximum survival?

To assess the survival of Platynereis larvae after adding the toxic retinal, Python will be used to simulate a dataset. Afterwards, this dataset will be plotted against several concentration values for choosing the best concentration.


## **Methods**

The random module was used for generating numbers. The generated data was used for plotting a graph from the matplotlib.pyplot module.


## **Results**

## Discussion


It would be cool to have (maybe with R?) an equation to compute significance between concentrations.

The colour red is not my favourite.
