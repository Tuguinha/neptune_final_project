# **Retinal survival assay in** *Platynereis dumerilii*

##:star: Introduction and Goals

The annelida phylum contains a great amount of variability in body plans. Many times, adaptation to novel environments resulted in a changes in body plan. This recurrent episodes of body plan evolution make them a good model for also understanding the evolution of Bilateria.

:grey_question: The goal of my project is to answer the question: What is the most suitable concentration of retinal for maximum survival?

To assess the survival of Platynereis larvae after adding the toxic retinal, Python will be used to simulate a dataset. Afterwards, this dataset will be plotted against several concentration values for choosing the best concentration.


## Methods

The [random module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html) was used for generating numbers.
The generated data was used for plotting a graph from the [matplotlib.pyplot module](http://matplotlib.org/index.html).


## Results

## :bulb: Discussion

- [x] In the end I realised that data collection will be done with time points against number of dead animals. :rage4:

- [ ] It would be cool to have (*maybe with R?*) an equation to compute significance between concentrations.
