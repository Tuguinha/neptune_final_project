## Introduction and Goals

The annelida phylum contains a great amount of variability in body plans. Many times, adaptation to novel environments resulted in a changes in body plan. This recurrent episodes of body plan evolution make them a good model for also understanding the evolution of Bilateria.
The marine annelid *Platynereis dumerilli* 

*The goal of my project is to answer the question, What is...?*
What is the best concentration of retinal to use taking into account survival time and imaging efficiency.

To assess the survival of Platynereis larvae after addition of the toxic retinal, Python will be used to simulate a dataset. Afterwards, this dataset will be plotted against several concentration values for better visualisation of the best concentration for future studies.
